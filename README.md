Games from assignment 1 of my Games Dev module

How to run the game
To run my game, unzipp the game and go to the StarshipFontana folder in the terminal and type “./start”


Changes made to the game

I have added a file to complie, build and run the game which can be used by typing “./start” in the main folder.

I have also made it that the aliens now move down the screen in a group of 10 and when they all either die or leave the screen another 10 will come down.

I made a scoreboard found in Score.cpp and Score.h which displays it to the window name and increments when you shoot a projectile.

The ship cant move off the screen. When it gets to the edge of the screen it will now just stop.

When the player hits an alien, 1 point will be taken of the score.

I added a coin as a pickup but it will not remove when you get it. The coin can only be collected once and then it goes off the screen like it would without collecting it.
